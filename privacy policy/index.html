                    <p>Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure about
                        how to <br> get the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to
                        build a Figma plugin <br> for the larger design community. The plugin is called the Ghost
                        UXWriter
                        and has a set of UX copies <br> cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone variation
                        ranging
                        from plain, casual to playful. The intention <br> to build this Figma plugin originated from our
                        Medium blog post, ‚ÄòDesigning voice and tone for <br> error messages.</p>
